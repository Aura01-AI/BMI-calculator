🧮 BMI Calculator (Body Mass Index) :
A simple Java console program to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) based on weight (kg) and height (cm).
Created as a beginner project to practice programming and learn how to use GitHub.

📘 How It Works
The user enters:
Weight in kilograms (kg)
Height in centimeters (cm)
(Height is converted from cm to meters using height / 100)
<18.5 → Underweight
18.5–24.9 → Normal
25–29.9 → Overweight
≥30 → Obesity
After displaying the result, the program will asks whether the user wants to calculate again or not:)

💫 How to Run the Program
Make sure Java is installed on your computer.
Save the file as KalkulatorBMI.java.
Open your terminal or command prompt, then run:
javac KalkulatorBMI.java
java KalkulatorBMI
Follow the on-screen instructions.
